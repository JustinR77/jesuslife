        Early Life
      </h2>
      <p>
        Jesus was born in Bethlehem. A city located in the fertile limestone hill country of the Holy Land, 10 kilometres south of Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scripture says that as He grew, He fell more in love with God's plan and will in His life. There was a moment where Mary (His mother) and Joseph (His father) took a 3-day trip to Jerusalem for a Holy Festival that was held every year. When the festival was over, Mary and Joseph left and didn't notice Jesus was not with them. 2 days into their travel back to Bethlehem, they turned back and went back to Jerusalem to find Jesus. When they found Him, He was at the table speaking with the teachers of the scripture about the scripture itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Bible doesn't go all that much into Jesus' younger years, we certainly know where His priorities were based on how the Jerusalem story ends. When Mary see's Him sitting with the teachers of the scripture, she asks Him, "Son, why have you treated us like this?" and Jesus responded saying, "Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?".
      </p>
      <p>
        Young Jesus knew His purpose of being brought to the face of the earth. Mary was a virgin when she was empregnated with Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ was a miracle from the Lord Himself. Young Jesus knew His purpose of being placed on the face of this earth. At a young age, He knew it was necessary to always be present in His Father's business.

        Adult Life
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Word of God speaks more of Jesus when he was an adult. In His adult life, He accomplished a lot. Jesus didn't work, nor did He have a home to lay His head. Jesus was always traveling from one place to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before Jesus started His ministry at the age of 30 years old, He was found with John the Baptist and John baptized Him in the Jordan River. John preached the gospel of repenting and coming to the feet of God, until one day Jesus showed up. Jesus was the man that John said "Not even I'm worthy of removing his sandals.".
      </p>
      <p>
        Once Jesus was baptized, He began His ministry. He started on His venture to find His 12 disciples in which He found with the guidance of God. Jesus lived to be 33 years old before He was unfairly crucified on the cross. But in the 3 years He had His ministry, He never failed in speaking God's word. He healed the sick, freed the demonized, taught the scripture, and preached the word of God.

        His Purpose
      </h2>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ. The name above all names. The scripture says that no name in heaven, on earth, or under earth has the power that the name of Jesus does. Jesus lived in heaven with His Father. Jesus lived in a place where everyone always praised Him. He was on top!
      </p>
      <p>
        Why did Jesus come down, and leave it all? The answer to that is easy...because He loved us. Jesus wasn't okay with the thought of His greatest creation being thrown into a pit of fire for all of an eternity. The scripture says HE loved us first. That love, is the reason why He left His throne of glory and came down to this wicked world, carried all of our sin, and took it to the cross.
      </p>
      <p>
        He never deserved the death that He got. We should've been the ones on that cross. We should have been the ones to get beat, spat on, abused, stabbed, punched, betrayed. But He paid the price. He took the beating, so we wouldn't have to. He did it so we could have access to eternal life.

        Would You Like Jesus?

        You may think that the solution to your problem may be talking to a therapist, physcologist, your friends, or your family. You may think that the solution to your problem may be running away or wiping yourself from the face of the earth. You may think that the solution to the emptiness you feel inside is to drink it away with alcohol or smoke it away with marijuana. Jesus wants to take every single ounce of your pain and throw it away. Jesus wants you to feel peace and joy in the midst of your situations. If you want Jesus in your life, I ask that you repeat this prayer:
      </p>
      <span>
        <em>
          "Jesus, I believe you are the Son of God, that you died on the cross to rescue me from sin and death and to restore me to the Father. I choose now to turn from my sins, my self-centeredness, and every part of my life that does not please you. I choose you. I give myself to you. I receive  your forgiveness and ask you to take your rightful place in my life as my Savior and Lord. Come reign in my heart, fill me with your love and your life, and help me to become a person who is truly lovingâ€”a person like you. Restore me, Jesus. Live in me. Love through me. Thank you, God. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."
        </em>
      </span>
      <p>
        Jesus loves you for exaclty who you are. Let Him guide the decisions you make. Always trust in Him no matter what. Give Him the Glory at all times. Never stop loving Him, because He will never stop loving you.
